            <p style="color:black" class="ss-paragraphs">When Morrison was about two years old, her family's landlord
               set fire to the house in which they lived, while they were home, because her parents could not pay the
               rent. Her family responded to what she called this "bizarre form of evil" by laughing at the landlord
               rather than falling into despair. Morrison later said her family's response demonstrated how to keep your
               integrity and claim your own life in the face of acts of such "monumental crudeness."[7]</p>
            <p style="color:black" class="">Toni Morrison was born in Lorain, Ohio, to Ramah (n√©e Willis) and George
               Wofford. She was the second of four children in a working-class, African-American family.[4] Her mother
               was born in Greenville, Alabama, and moved north with her family as a child. Her father grew up in
               Cartersville, Georgia, and when he was about 15, white people lynched two black businessmen who lived on
               his street. Morrison said: "He never told us that he'd seen bodies. But he had seen them. And that was
               too traumatic, I think, for him."[5] Soon after the lynching, George Wofford moved to the racially
               integrated town of Lorain, Ohio, in the hope of escaping racism and securing gainful employment in Ohio's
               burgeoning industrial economy. He worked odd jobs and as a welder for U.S. Steel. Ramah Wofford was a
               homemaker and a devout member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.[6].</p>
